# Portifolio Project.
## Description:
this project is made using resources from codeacademys machinelearning and ai engineer course, all the work done within is made by myself to showcase my different skills within these domains. The data set used for this project originates from: 
* https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success
and is a classifacation problem, with data that is sadly complete and thus does need and extended amount off cleaning. Throughout this project i will be using a jupyter notebook.
